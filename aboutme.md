- Currently a Pharm. D./ M.S. Pharmaceutical Sciences student at the University at Buffalo in my last year under Dr. Robert Bies. My research focuses on the use of population PK/PD modeling to optimize antipsychotic therapy. 

- Research intern at the Institute for Clinical Pharmacodynamics. Have worked on projects spanning a variety of topics including drug-drug-interaction models, population PK, model-based dose selection, etc.

- When I'm not studying/working I like learning new programming lanuguages (NERD!), spending time with friends/family, playing board games (NERD!), meeting new people, and watching football.
